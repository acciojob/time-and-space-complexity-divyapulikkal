	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that helps us analyze the efficiency of algorithms. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. In other words, it evaluates how the execution time of an algorithm increases as the input grows larger. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, ensuring that they can handle larger inputs without significantly slowing down.</p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b>, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory or space an algorithm requires to solve a problem. It evaluates how the memory usage of an algorithm scales with the input size. An algorithm's space complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. A space complexity of O(n) indicates that the amount of memory used by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size.</p>
