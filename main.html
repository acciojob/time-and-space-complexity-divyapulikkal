	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm. Time complexity is very efficient measure in algorithm analysis.
	</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.It represent O(n)</p>
